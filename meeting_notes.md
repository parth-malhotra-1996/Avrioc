### Meeting Date : 16-Dec-2022
### Agenda : Non-prod Cluster Review 
### Duration : 0.5 hours
___
#### Notes:
* A fresh installation of non-prod cluster was made prior to the call
* Cluster review was performed by triggering API commands for clusters and nodes
* Diagnostics was run on the cluster which needs to be analysed for mapping issues, indexing issues etc.


#### Action Points :
* #### Elastic
    * Look into the steps or script to mask the sensitive information ( like IP address) to share/upload the api-diagnostics file (else they need to go through a lot of approvals for sharing the file)
    * How to utilize the Non-prod licenses they've been provided along with the prod ones
